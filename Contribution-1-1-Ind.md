## Open Source Contributions

Contributions to open source projects can be of widely varying content, complexity and motivation. Therefore, contributions can be categorized into different classes and types to allow for providing concrete guidance for each.
In general, there are two separate classes of contributions:

1. contributions to existing open source projects, and
1. the creation of new projects, including open sourcing entire proprietary code bases.

These two classes differ significantly in terms of motivations, (business) reasons as well as legal considerations and practical execution. Therefore, Section 3 will cover each class separately.
Within the class of contributions to existing projects, contributions can be of very different nature, both in terms of technical complexity as well as in terms of what is being contributed. Regarding technical complexity, contributions can range from simple bug fixes (e.g., typos) to the addition of complex new features. Moreover, contributions are not limited to source code, but generally include any form of content (e.g., documentation), information (e.g., bug reports and feature requests) or support (e.g., infrastructure, marketing, release management).
Each type of contribution may require a different approach, both regarding engaging with an open source project as well as company-internal processes. Therefore, this material differentiates five types of contributions to existing open source projects:

1. Bug reports and feature requests,
1. Bugfixes and corrections,
1. Supporting contributions,
1. Individual features, and
1. Strategic industry leading engagements.

**Bug reports and feature requests:** This type of contribution typically does not comprise source code, but instead is feedback to the project regarding incorrect behavior of the software, e.g., a bug report, or a request and value argumentation for a new feature. As those reports or requests typically do not comprise code (apart from potentially fractions of pseudocode), contributors fully rely on members of the development community to pick up these requests for implementation.

**Bugfixes and corrections:** Bugfixes are corrections of unintended and/or incorrect behavior of a software, in particular including vulnerabilities, often in response to bug reports. Bugfixes implement changes and/or additions to a code base within the scope of existing functionality. Therefore, bugfixes modify existing code, but can also add new code for handling previously unhandled scenarios or corner cases in the existing logic. Outside of such additions, bugfixes do not add new functionality to a codebase. Bugfixes are typically small in terms of the number of changed lines of code.

**Supporting contributions:** Supporting contributions are improvements of an open source project outside of the core functional scope of a project, but instead they are supportive in nature, aiming to improve a project’s maturity and adoption. Such contributions comprise for example:

* improvements of a project’s documentation,
* its build system,
* test cases and frameworks,
* release management,
* code reviews, and
* presentations
