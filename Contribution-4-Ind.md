## Engaging in a FOSS project as a company employee 

### Why be a contributor? Personal benefits of being a contributor
Contributing to open-source software development can be a rewarding and motivating endeavor, offering a lot of reasons to get involved as an employee. It is worth noting that these motivating factors align with those that drive other individuals and organizations to contribute to open-source initiatives, as described in Section 2.1.

From the developer's perspective, the commitment needed for engaging in open-source contributions can vary. A general recommendation is that a developer should commit at a level where he or she has sufficient time to understand the issue, write code, and engage with the community while at the same time remaining flexible enough to manage other commitments and ensure a healthy work-life balance, (LogicaBeans, 2023) and (Wearedevelopers, 2022) .

Open-source development can serve as a good platform for personal growth, (Nyakundi, 2023). Through contributions, a developer gains hands-on experience, collaborates with experienced developers, and experiments with the latest technologies, all of which enhance their skill sets and broaden their horizons. This platform allows developers to update their knowledge and skills regularly, offering a challenging but rewarding learning process. 

When engaging in open-source projects, developers get the opportunity to connect with professionals, make friends, and even find mentors who can provide guidance and support in your career. By navigating social dynamics effectively, developers build relationships that can contribute to personal and professional growth. Also, this sense of belonging and team spirit within an open-source community, is a powerful motivator.

Open-source contributions can enhance a developer’s professional portfolio, making the developer more attractive within the company as well as externally. These contributions highlight technical skills, commitment to continuous learning, and the ability to effectively collaborate within a larger and diverse community. Many companies value open-source experience as it reflects developer’s dedication and competence. 

Participating in an open source project can provide a sense of giving back to the community that has enriched developer skills and knowledge. Sharing expertise and mentoring others is a way to serve the community while simultaneously expanding the developer’s perspective.

Most open-source projects often address real-world problems, making the developer’s contributions directly impactful. Whether a developer adds a new feature, fixes a bug, or improves documentation, their contributions have the potential to make a difference. As developers witness their contributions being used by others, including their own company, they might gain a sense of achievement and satisfaction, knowing that their efforts benefit not only their team and company but also the wider community.

### Important skill sets
The open-source world is vast with diverse range of projects that require various skills and expertise. People from all backgrounds participate, and open-source communities usually welcome all suitable skills, which help build and improve their projects. Whether the involvement is minimal or substantial, the contribution will be valued and appreciated by the community. However, when companies consider appointing an employee to contribute to open-source projects, certain skills and expertise can be more efficient than others. The specific set of skills required depends on what to achieve, the company’s strategic goal, and the available role.

The core skills and knowledge open-source software projects often asks for are:

**Technical skills**
•	Knowledge of version control systems, such as Git for collaboration and tracking changes.

•	Knowledge of the release process, from idea and feature requests, coding, testing, and deployment, including tracking, versioning, and changelogs. 

•	Knowledge of syntax, semantics, data structures and algorithms of the programming languages used in the project.

•	Familiarity with the advantages and disadvantages of different languages and technologies.

•	Knowledge of open-source development tools, libraries, and frameworks and how to integrate them.

•	Ability to follow coding standards and best practices. 

•	Skills in designing user interfaces that are responsive, intuitive, and user-friendly.

•	Knowledge of data modelling and database design.

•	Skills in cybersecurity methodologies, such as threat and vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.

•	Skills in testing methodologies, test and bug reporting and software requirements.

•	Analytical problem-solving skills.

•	Knowledge of open-source licenses and company IP.

•	Field-specific technical and business skills.

**Soft Skills or Power skills** 
Besides technical skills, open-source projects always need and benefit from:

•	Effective collaboration and communication skills.

•	Proficient writing skills to create clear, concise, and informative documentation and provide guidance. 

•	Ability to view and document from the user’s perspective.

•	Project management skills to oversee software development and maintenance.

•	Leadership skills to foster a sense of inclusive community with positive engagement and collaboration.

The set of skills outlined above serves as a foundation for contributing to open-source initiatives but is not exhaustive. The list of skills can expand for more complex projects or made more precise for smaller ones. Specific requirements depend on the project's complexity, type, and the role. For instance, the role maintainer should be excellent in soft skills and release management, while the role contributor might not need to be as proficient in these areas. Precise skill sets, and proficiency levels should be tailored considering the project objectives and the company’s strategic goals.

### Ethical Responsibilities
Anyone representing a company as a professional in the open-source software community are presented with unique opportunities, but also entrusted with significant responsibilities. That employee becomes part of the company’s branding, representing its values and commitment to collaboration, innovation, and excellence in every interaction with the open-source community. It is essential to not just develop the technical expertise but have strong ethical mindset that is aligned with the specific demands and the subtle distinction of the role. Understanding and executing these responsibilities are of greatest importance when participating in open-source software initiatives.

**Key responsibilities and best practices:** 

As contributing employee, it is crucial to
•	**Understand company policies:** Read and understand the company's code of conduct and its policy on open-source contributions. Ensure staying within them and secure the necessary approvals to contribute to the project. Keep in mind that the employee is responsible for his/her conduct and should always act with the company's principles and values in mind. In situations where the right course of action is not clear, the employee should not hesitate to contact and consult the company’s support functions. As a general principle, if something seems unethical or improper, it probably is. 

•	**Build legal and IP skills:** Be knowledgeable about open-source licenses, contributor license agreements (CLA), and developer certificate of origin (DCO) to ensure compliance and avoid legal pitfalls. Protect company IP and ensure not to share proprietary or otherwise confidential company information, see Chapter 3.

•	**Respect community norms:** Each community has its own culture, norms, guidelines, agreements (CLA or DCO) and codes of conduct, see Chapter 3. Understand and respect these rules and guidelines, including contribution guidelines. Contribute in a manner that is in harmony with the community's culture. Ensure that these expectations are in line with the company's policies and code of conduct. 

•	**Understand the objectives:** Grasp the company’s overall strategic objectives and the project’s specific goals. Clearly understand the reasons for the company involvement in the open-source project, and ensure that any actions and contributions align with these objectives and the company’s broader mission, see Chapter 2.

•	**Keep high standards:** Maintain the quality and professionalism expected of the company, including excellence in coding, documentation, and communication. Represent the company in a professional manner in all interactions within the community.

•	**Be honest and sincere:** Be transparent with your company association while contributing to open-source projects. Identify and disclose any potential conflicts of interest, particularly in discussions that may affect the employer. Always behave ethically.

•	**Contribute meaningfully:** Read through the project documentations, including issues trackers and learn from past discussions and ensure understanding of the community's needs, priorities, interests, and way of working. Prioritize features and issues that align with the company's interests and contribute to them. Document and explain why the contributions are important and valuable to the project and for the use cases.

•	**Stay updated:** Open-source projects evolve rapidly. Stay engaged and keep up with the latest updates and trends in both technologies used and the business industry. Cultivate a curious mindset and develop technical and communication skills. 

•	**Collaborate:** Work closely with internal teams to harness collective expertise and be efficient. Learn how the project members communicate, and participate in community discussions, forums, mailing lists, and building relationships. Build and maintain relationships among community members, company employees, and other technical leaders within software development.

•	**Cultivate community spirit:** Embrace a positive and friendly attitude towards community members and company employees. Never disrespect or discriminate but foster an inclusive environment. Being nice and welcoming other contributors helps to build a supportive and collaborative environment.

•	**Have patience and empathy:** Be patient and understand that responses and deliveries could take time and respect that different contributors have different schedules and responsibilities.

•	**Value feedback:** Listen to and learn from others. Be open to feedback and show willingness to change if necessary.

•	**Be firm:** Do not feel guilty and stand up for what you believe is right for the project and the company, while being polite. People can understand more than you think if you give them respect and justification.

•	**Take care of yourself:** Take breaks now and then throughout the working day and practice a healthy work-life balance.

While this list provides key principles regarding responsibilities and ethical considerations expected by an employee contributing to open-source software projects, it is not exhaustive. In addition, the outlined principles can be adapted to suit various roles within open software contribution, when developing role-specific descriptions.

By embracing these responsibilities and best practices, you are upholding the ethical standard expected from professionals, while contributing to the sustainable growth of the project, the integrity of the open-source software community, and the image of the company. This can also put you on a pathway to success in your career.
