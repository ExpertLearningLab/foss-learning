# Open-source software repositories
A software project is composed of multiple artifacts, such as its source code and tests, the documentation, as well as configuration and installation scripts. If the artifacts of a software project are available publicly, to read and modify, the software is said to be __open-source__. Open-source projects are hosted as code repositories on online platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), and [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/directory/), to name a few.

As an example, let us consider the [widely-used](https://xkcd.com/1823/), open-source text editor called [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)). Vim is freely available through its [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/vim/vim). In addition to the actual code that powers Vim, this repository also showcases a comprehensive introduction to this software project. The repository documents how Vim can be built from the source code, guidelines for how individuals can contribute, as well as statistics such as the major programming languages that Vim is implemented in. Much like this repository, the [`README` file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README), is usually a very good place to start when first learning about an open-source project. The contents of the `README` file within each directory of a project are automatically displayed when browsing through its repository. This is also the case for the feature-rich and powerful [Inkspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape) vector image editing tool, hosted as an open-source [repository on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape).

Regardless of the specific platform where an open-source project is hosted, browsing through its repository can be an informative and rather fun exercise. It allows us to gain insights into how the project has evolved with time, issues and bugs that have been discovered, those that have been resolved, as well as code contributions made by the open-source community. Moreover, we also learn about other open-source technologies that power the project, which opens up more avenues for exploration.

## Contributors (number, origin, leadership)
A software project typically has multiple contributors. For instance, an individual may contribute to the source code with the implementation of a new feature, to fix a bug, or to improve the documentation. Open-source software projects maintain a list of individuals who have contributed to them.
