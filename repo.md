# Open source software repository
A software project is composed of multiple artifacts, such as its source code and tests, the documentation, as well as configuration and installation scripts. If the artifacts of a software project are available publicly, to read and modify, the software is said to be __open-source__. Open-source projects are hosted as code repositories on websites such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), and [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/directory/) to name a few. 

## Contributors (number, origin, leadership)
A software project typically has multiple contributors. For instance, an individual may contribute to the source code with the implementation of a new feature or to fix a bug, or to improve the documentation. Open-source software projects maintain a list of individuals who have contributed to them.
