## Engaging in an open source software project as a company employee

### Why be a contributor? Personal benefits of being a contributor

Contributing to open source software development can be a rewarding and motivating endeavor, offering a lot of reasons to get involved as an employee. It is worth noting that these motivating factors align with those that drive other individuals and organizations to contribute to open source initiatives, as described in Module 2.
From the developer's perspective, the commitment needed for engaging in open source contributions can vary. A general recommendation is that a developer should commit at a level where he or she has sufficient time to understand the issue, write code, and engage with the community while at the same time remaining flexible enough to manage other commitments and ensure a healthy [work-life balance](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/promote-work-life-balance-software-developers-logicabeans){:target="_blank"}, (LogicaBeans, 2023) and (Wearedevelopers, 2022).

Open source development can serve as a good platform for personal growth, (Nyakundi, 2023). Through contributions, a developer gains hands-on experience, collaborates with experienced developers, and experiments with the latest technologies, all of which enhance their skill sets and broaden their horizons. This platform allows developers to update their knowledge and skills regularly, offering a challenging but rewarding learning process.

When engaging in open source projects, developers get the opportunity to connect with professionals, make friends, and even find mentors who can provide guidance and support in your career. By navigating social dynamics effectively, developers build relationships that can contribute to personal and professional growth. Also, this sense of belonging and team spirit within an open source community, is a powerful motivator.

Open source contributions can enhance a [developer's professional portfolio](https://medium.com/@jaybharadiya/6-benefits-of-contributing-to-open-source-projects-in-the-software-industry-562ea3f5abf6){:target="_blank"}, making the developer more attractive within the company as well as externally. These contributions highlight technical skills, commitment to continuous learning, and the ability to effectively collaborate within a larger and diverse community. Many companies value open source experience as it reflects developer’s dedication and competence.

Participating in an open source project can provide a sense of giving back to the community that has enriched developer skills and knowledge. Sharing expertise and mentoring others is a way to serve the community while simultaneously expanding the developer’s perspective.

Most open source projects often address real-world problems, making the developer’s contributions directly impactful. Whether a developer adds a new feature, fixes a bug, or improves documentation, their contributions have the potential to make a difference. As developers witness their contributions being used by others, including their own company, they might gain a sense of achievement and satisfaction, knowing that their efforts benefit not only their team and company but also the wider community.

### Important skill sets

The open source world is vast with diverse range of projects that require various skills and expertise. People from all backgrounds participate, and open source communities usually welcome all suitable skills, which help build and improve their projects. Whether the involvement is minimal or substantial, the contribution will be valued and appreciated by the community. However, when companies consider appointing an employee to contribute to open source projects, certain skills and expertise can be more efficient than others. The specific set of skills required depends on what to achieve, the company’s strategic goal, and the available role.

The [core skills and knowledge](https://medium.com/quick-code/essential-skills-that-every-open-source-developer-needs-d37ac668faf8){:target="_blank"} open source software projects often asks for are:

#### Technical skills

* Knowledge of version control systems, such as Git for collaboration and tracking changes.
* Knowledge of the release process, from idea and feature requests, coding, testing, and deployment, including tracking, versioning, and changelogs.
* Knowledge of syntax, semantics, data structures and algorithms of the programming languages used in the project.
* Familiarity with the advantages and disadvantages of different languages and technologies.
* Knowledge of open source development tools, libraries, and frameworks and how to integrate them.
* Ability to follow coding standards and best practices.
* Skills in designing user interfaces that are responsive, intuitive, and user-friendly.
* Knowledge of data modelling and database design.
* Skills in cybersecurity methodologies, such as threat and vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.
* Skills in testing methodologies, test and bug reporting and software requirements.
* Analytical problem-solving skills.
* Knowledge of open source licenses and company IP.
* Field-specific technical and business skills.

#### Soft Skills

Besides technical skills, open source projects always need and benefit from:

* [Effective collaboration and communication skills](https://ca.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/collaboration-skills){:target="_blank"}.
* Proficient writing skills to create clear, concise, and informative documentation and provide guidance.
* Ability to view and document from the user’s perspective.
* Project management skills to oversee software development and maintenance.
* Leadership skills to foster a sense of inclusive community with positive engagement and collaboration.

The set of skills outlined above serves as a foundation for contributing to open source initiatives but is not exhaustive. The list of skills can expand for more complex projects or made more precise for smaller ones. Specific requirements depend on the project's complexity, type, and the role. For instance, the role maintainer should be excellent in soft skills and release management, while the role contributor might not need to be as proficient in these areas. Precise skill sets, and proficiency levels should be tailored considering the project objectives and the company’s strategic goals.

### Ethical Responsibilities

Anyone representing a company as a professional in the open source software community are presented with unique opportunities, but also entrusted with significant responsibilities. That employee becomes part of the company’s branding, representing its values and commitment to collaboration, innovation, and excellence in every interaction with the open source community. It is essential to not just develop the technical expertise but have strong ethical mindset that is aligned with the specific demands and the subtle distinction of the role. Understanding and executing these responsibilities are of greatest importance when participating in open source software initiatives.

**Key responsibilities and best practices:**

As contributing employee, it is crucial to
