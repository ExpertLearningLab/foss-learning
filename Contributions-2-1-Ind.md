## Business reasons for engaging in open source software development

When a company actively participates in open source software development by contributing code, resources, or expertise to open source software projects, it can derive several strategic advantages. Contribution is not just an act of goodwill but should be treated as a strategic move that aligns with the company’s broader goals and objectives.

### Strategic advantages of open source software contribution

Engaging in open source software contribution can align seamlessly with strategic business objectives, if done right. By using readily available open source components, companies can avoid reinventing the wheel and allocate resources more efficiently. Moreover, participating in open source communities can position a company at the forefront of innovation, providing access to emerging technologies and methodologies that can be integrated into their offerings. The important aspect of participating is to accelerate the evolution of a new technology and make it suitable for ones use cases. Consumption alone leaves you with what’s available. This engagement also expands market reach, tapping into a global pool of users and developers. Importantly, making appreciated contributions will also enhance a company’s influence and reputation within these communities, which can be a vital enabler for its open source strategy.

Strategic engagement in open source development can be crucial for securing a reliable technology supply. This involves identifying open source software components that are critical to the company's operation and developing a strategy to ensure their continued availability. By actively contributing to these components, a company can safeguard its technology supply, retaining the ability to use and adapt these components as needed.

Another strategic approach involves leveraging "early adopters" within the community. Early adopters can provide valuable feedback on new ideas or technologies at an early stage. By engaging the users in the community, a company can assess how a new technology or idea will be received before committing significant investments. This approach allows for agile adaptations based on real-world feedback, ensuring that developments are in line with community needs and expectations.

In the landscape of open source software, traditional business strategies, especially those involving financial influence, often need reevaluation. While many companies may use money to exert influence, this approach is not necessarily effective in open source environments. Unlike traditional business models where financial power drives decisions, open source software projects are primarily influenced by contributions. These contributions, whether in the form of code, expertise, or community support, are the true currency of influence in the world of open source software development.

Strategic engagements are closely tied to a long-term business strategy and require substantial staffing and long-term commitment.

### Product development through open source software

The open source model offers a unique advantage in product development. By using de-facto industry standard open source software components, a company can build its product(s) leveraging those and thereby accelerate product development. However, relying on these components also involves a degree of dependency on the community for updates and support. To mitigate risks such as delayed community support, companies can develop solutions or bug fixes and then contribute this back to the community for mutual benefit. This relationship results in easier maintenance, faster feature development, and overall higher quality. Contributions should be closely aligned with the strategy and roadmap of a product to ensure business relevance.

Additionally, open source software contributions can be strategically used for competitive advantages. Companies can initiate or contribute to open source software projects to develop new products or frameworks that are aligned with and support existing product ecosystems. This strategy can establish a company's dominance in specific technical areas. Apple's development of Swift, Google's investment in Android, and Microsoft's contribution to .NET and C# are examples of how leading tech companies have used open source contributions to create platforms that serve immediate product needs and set industry standards. Such strategic contributions allow companies to shape the technical landscape in ways that favor their products and services, which can give them a significant competitive advantage.
