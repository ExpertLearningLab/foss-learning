## The business process of making an open source software contribution

### Contributions to existing open source software projects
The business process of engaging in existing open source software projects can be set up in various ways and be subject to different governance models, depending on a company’s needs and capabilities. 
Regardless of if the decision is made through an ad hoc process or if it passes through a sophisticated setup (e.g. with an Open Source Program Office (OSPO)), the process should in the end lead to the following three cornerstones:
•	Purpose. A defined purpose for the specific contribution activity.

•	Suitability. A suitability assessment from relevant perspectives, based on the purpose.

•	Conscious decision. A conscious decision based on the above, including the allocation of adequate and suitable resources.

Please note: This module does not refer to spare-time contributions made by employees outside of work. In that context, it is important to note that in most cases (either by law or contract), the copyright to a developer’s code – insofar as it falls within his or her job description – will be automatically transferred to the employer. It is generally advisable for companies to have a process to get notified about and approve employee spare-time activities that may border to or affect the day-to-day work, subject to local employment legislation. Open source software contributions are not an exception in that regard.

### Defining the purpose of the open source software contribution
As described in module 2, there are many possible reasons for a company to engage in open source software development through contributions. When considering a specific contribution case, the task is essentially to identify which of these reasons apply to the case in question. In short: why make this contribution?
If there is no obvious answer to that question, it is likely due to one out of two reasons: 

1.	The company is immature in the open source software business strategic dimension, lacking sufficient capabilities, structures and/or strategies to answer the question.
See Module 2.

2.	The contribution does not fit with the company strategy and is thereby questionable.


On the other hand, if there is an obvious business reason to engage in a particular open source software project, the question “why” will generally be relatively simple to answer and define. 

For instance, the reason may be that the company is relying on a specific open source software component which has a declining community, and the company therefore wants to boost the continued engagement and redundance in the open source software project. Defining such a purpose will immediately uncover several aspects. To begin with, to truly boost engagement in the open source software project, it is unlikely that sporadic issue reports or the occasional suggestion of a bug fix will do enough to fulfil the purpose. Instead, it is likely that the company may need to engage continuously, also with more substantial types of contributions (see module 1) and even commit to assume roles higher up in the project hierarchy (see module 1).

When the question “why” is answered, the possibility to assess the contribution is significantly improved, both in terms of suitability and in terms of needed resources, engagement, timeframe, etc.

In companies with a mature open source development management organization and where governance has been established, standardized forms for contribution requests should preferably require the internal requester to specify the open source software project in question and the reasons for engaging in it. This can be particularly helpful in larger organizations and/or in companies with a high volume of open source software contribution requests. As a suggestion, such forms could include:

•	The name and scope of the open source software project

•	Relevant links (to the repository, project website and the website of any governing body such as the relevant Open Source Foundation)

•	Information about the type(s) of contribution(s) intended
  o	If source code will be contributed, a specification of the same
•	The reason(s) why the contribution(s) would be beneficial for the company

•	Exit criteria (if it is a continuous contribution)

### Suitability assessment 
With the intended purpose established, the next step is to assess the suitability of the contribution. 

•	Will the potential benefits warrant the effort needed? 

•	How likely is the company to achieve the purpose by making the contribution(s)?

•	Are there any risks connected to the activity?

One part of this assessment is of a business- and technical character, as covered in this section. The next section will cover the legal and intellectual property rights aspects of the suitability assessment. Together with the purpose, these two suitability dimensions will constitute a basis for the decision to contribute or not.

**•	Resource allocation.** A fundamental question is resource allocation, which is in turn closely connected to the type of contribution. In cases of one-time bugfixes and corrections, the contribution may not demand much more than the push of a button (if the fix has already been developed internally). Such momentary cases will of course not require any significant additional resources. On the other hand, if the intention is to strategically engage in the open source software project over time, the company will need to allocate internal resources to the project, such as developers, project managers, or other necessary personnel. Consequently, for larger contribution activities, the company needs to balance the open source software project activity against other prioritized activities. In general, it is recommended to assure that a continuous contribution activity has an internal “owner” and/or that contributions are funneled through some kind of control instance, such as an Open Source Program Office (OSPO) and/or a cross-competence team set up for governance purposes.
  
**•	Technical and financial boundaries.** For continuous engagement in open source software projects, it may be necessary to define certain boundaries of both technical and financial character. Heavy engagement may e.g. involve paid membership in a governing body, frequent meetings and/or substantial engagement of internal developers, which suggests keeping a budget or taking other measures for cost control purposes. Further, it may also be worth considering which technical boundaries – if any – that should be settled for the contribution. Such boundaries could apply to the general project evolution, i.e. if the open source software project pivots in an irrelevant or misaligned direction, the company may have decreased strategic interest to stay involved, or face the decision whether to fork out a subproject. A technical boundary could also be necessary in terms of the contributions as such, i.e. the company may be comfortable contributing code for a particular part of the open source software project, but unwilling – for strategic reasons – to share in other adjacent technical areas. Whether expressed as formal boundaries/mandates or not, it is recommended to consider whether any such framing is needed for any given engagement. The boundaries can also be used to define exit criteria for the engagement.

**•	Brand exposure:** Once the company starts interacting with and contributing to the open source software project, it will associate its brand with the project and any company developers will represent the company brand in the context. Generally speaking, the larger the contribution/engagement, the larger the brand exposure. As such, the company should assess if there are any bad will risks entailed with being associated with the open source software project. Bad will risks may also arise if the company provides poor quality contributions or if its employees misbehave in the open source software project, e.g. acting in breach of the project’s Code of Conduct. On the other hand, being associated with an open source software project in a positive way will of course carry a potential of goodwill, thereby strengthening the company brand. The decision to support an open source software project might be an opportunity for the marketing unit to provide a press release on the topic and thus strengthening the perception of the company as an open source software friendly company.


## Suitability assessment – Legal & Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
Depending on the type of contribution and the scope thereof (see Section 1.2 above), various legal and IPR aspects may need to be considered. In short, the company needs to:

•	Ensure that it is not violating third party rights.

•	Avoid non-intended exposure of its own proprietary assets.

•	Ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations. 

•	Observe any legal instruments required by the FOSS project in question (such as Contributor License Agreements or Developer Certificates of Origin).

### Third party rights

A fundamental starting point when considering a contribution is that the contributing company has appropriately secured the right to do so in the first place. Any source code and corresponding documentation should be assumed to be protected by copyright unless the contribution is rudimentary to the point where it can safely be assumed to lack originality.  In unclear cases, it is generally advisable to involve legal counsel before ruling out copyright as a relevant factor.
 
Before making a contribution of copyright-protected material, consider the following:
 
•	Ensure that you know who the author(s) of the material are. 

•	If any part of the material was created by a third party, such as a consultant or a supplier, review the contract to ensure that the title and ownership of the copyright was passed on to your company or that you otherwise received license rights that would allow you to make the contemplated contribution. If such contract is not in place, or if the existing contract does not explicitly grant sufficient rights to make a contribution, do not proceed with the contribution until an adequate contract or contract amendment has been negotiated with the copyright holder.

•	If the material has been developed independently or if it may include portions of material made by others, for instance by copying and pasting code snippets or text passages from other sources. In the latter case, it will be necessary to assess from a copyright perspective whether this use of third party sources prevents the contribution in question. 

•	If the material has been developed with the support of generative AI, it may require additional considerations depending on the AI tool in question. This includes, for instance, whether the terms and conditions of the AI tool allows for such use of its output, and to which extent the output is truly generative rather than derivative from the dataset that the AI tool has been trained on. Please note that it is unlikely that material created exclusively by an AI is possible to protect by means of intellectual property rights, such as copyright. 

Apart from copyright, a contribution may also be subject to other third party rights. For instance:
 
•	It may contain trade secrets or confidential information of third parties. Be aware that a contribution to an open source project will be a public disclosure of the information in question. It is therefore important to ensure that the contribution does not breach any confidentiality obligations or otherwise misappropriate any trade secrets of others.

•	The use, functionality or specific implementations of the contribution may be subject to third party patent rights. In contrast to the literal scope of copyright protection, patents protect technical inventions – products or processes, i.e. a certain functionality. As such, even if the copyright to the code contribution belongs with the contributing company, using the code can at the same time be infringing on third party patent rights if it facilitates the execution of a patent-protected invention in a specific technical context. For minor contributions (bugfixes, etc.), this is unlikely an issue, but when contributing new features to an open source software project, align with the internal IP department or an IP expert about whether to perform freedom-to-operate patent investigations before making such contributions.

### The legal consequence of contributing an information asset to an open source software project

Contributing to an open source software project is an act of transforming company-internal information – be it code, know-how, experience, or documentation – into an external asset shared with others. It is generally an irreversible transaction without any direct monetary reimbursement. As such, as mentioned in the beginning of this module 3, it is important from a business perspective to make a conscious decision about what to share and how. 

From the legal perspective, the company will normally not assign or transfer its ownership of the intellectual property rights of the contributed asset. However, by making the contribution, the company will essentially pledge the asset and the corresponding intellectual property rights to become open in a manner which will significantly reduce the possibilities for the company to restrict future use of the contributed asset – except for enforcement vis-á-vis future users who do not comply with the open source software license in question. This loss of legal control should be viewed as part of the price of becoming a contributor. 

Open source software projects will from time to time use various legal instruments to ensure the company’s and/or developer’s commitment to the contribution.

•	To begin with, the open source software project will have a license regime for outbound licensing where one or more licenses are predominantly used or required for the downstream distribution. Such license regime may be defined in the project charter (if such charter exists) or elsewhere. At the very least, there is typically one or more LICENSE files in the repository. Although most open source software licenses focus on the outbound, downstream licensing rather than how to receive contributions, some open source software licenses also include specific terms and conditions for making contributions, such as the Apache License, Version 2.0. 

•	A frequently used open source software project philosophy is inbound = outbound, meaning that the project has declared (e.g. in the project charter or a CONTRIBUTIONS file) that it only accepts contributions under the same license as the outbound license. As such, making a contribution to the project will be assumed to be licensed in to the project on the same terms as it is licensed out from the project.

•	In order to legally solidify and secure the commitment of contributors, some open source software projects also use so-called Developer Certificates of Origin (DCO), Contributor License Agreements (CLA), or similar. 

•	A DCO is a unilateral sign-off by the contributor certifying that it has the adequate rights to make the contribution and that it understands the public nature of the contribution (including the sign-off).  Different open source software projects may use different mechanisms for recording the DCO, but the typical approach is that the sign-off is embedded in the git commits.

•	A CLA is an agreement between the contributor – an individual or a legal entity – and the open source software project owner.  In general, the purpose of a CLA is to improve the project’s ability to rely on contributions from a contributor. Please note that a CLA may in various ways extend beyond the contribution at hand, e.g. to cover any future contributions by employees of a company or group of companies. As such, it is strongly recommended to review and understand the terms and conditions of any CLA before signing it and proceeding with contributions.

•	As mentioned above, most open source software projects will retrieve contributions on a license basis, and not by transfer of ownership. However, a project can of course in theory acquire the intellectual property rights (IPR) instead of licensing it. To do so, an IPR assignment agreement would have to be executed between the contributor and project owner. Please note that an assignment of the IPR in a contribution would entail a complete transfer of rights and should as such be carefully deliberated before it is accepted.

•	Before making a contribution, a company should make sure to review and understand the implications of the specific CLA, DCO or other terms and conditions applicable for the contribution. 

•	To which extent the contributor is legally bound to the terms and conditions set out by an open source software project depends on the circumstances in the specific case. A signed CLA will of course more solidly establish the contribution than a general inbound=outbound principle. 

In summary, a contributing company should consider the following:

•	Different open source software projects will have different methods of validating your contribution, ranging from implicit presumptions to requiring formal agreements. In any case, there will be a general expectation that your contribution becomes open source software.

•	Whether or not the contributing company is legally bound by the terms and conditions of an open source software project will depend on the circumstances in the specific case, but a general approach for a contributing company should be to avoid any ambiguity and potential conflicts in this regard.

•	If – for some reason – the contributing company wishes to make any reservations or contribute under different terms and conditions than what is established/assumed in the open source software project, it is important to be clear and explicit about such reservations. A suggestion is to reach out to the project owner or a maintainer to initiate a dialogue about a potential conditional contribution before making the contribution. 


### Compliance with laws and regulations
Apart from what is stated above, participation in an open source software project – depending on its nature – may trigger various regulatory considerations. This is not unique to open source software projects as such, but nevertheless important to keep in mind. 
•	For instance, competitor representatives may interact in steering committees or other forums of an open source software project, which entails competition/antitrust law considerations.
 
•	In any context where representatives from actual or potential competitors are participating, it is advisable to avoid any sharing of commercially sensitive information and to have customary mechanisms to remind and record diligence with applicable competition/antitrust law regimes.

•	Larger open source software projects and/or Open Source Foundations may have their own antitrust guidelines.  Many companies will also have their own policies in respect of competition law compliance. Contributors should ensure awareness of such guidelines and policies and assess whether they require any particular actions or precautions for the intended engagement.

•	Moreover, the technology in itself – or its distribution – may be regulated, for instance under export control regulation (although published open source software is often exempted) or specific product or technology legislation. Involve relevant experts as necessary in cases of uncertainty whether specific code or documentation can be shared in an open source software context and/or if it requires specific measures, such as BIS and NSA notifications for non-standard cryptography software.  Certain technology fields may also in various jurisdictions be subject to special regulation. 


## Creating a new open source software project
Deciding to create a new open source software project shares many of the same considerations with the choice of making major or continuous contributions to existing open source software projects. For instance, the three cornerstones are equally applicable
:
•	Purpose. A defined purpose for creating the open source software project.

•	Suitability. A suitability assessment from relevant perspectives, based on the purpose.

•	Conscious decision. A conscious decision based on the above, including the allocation of adequate and suitable resources.
A significant difference, however, is that the creator of a new open source software project needs to take several additional decisions to establish the project in the first place, and that the project essentially needs to be viewed as any other software development project. In other words, it needs to be planned, staffed, funded, launched, governed, and maintained over the project lifecycle.  Further, the success of the project will depend on successful external community building.  

### Defining the purpose of the open source software project
Similar to what is described in module 3 for contributions to existing open source software projects, it is important to have a clear purpose for creating an open source software project. Why should we create this project?
Given that it will require some effort, and that internal assets will be published under a (more or less) permissive open source software license, there should be an obvious business reason to start the project. 
For instance, the reason could be to push an open standard in a software layer that drives a lot of internal development costs, but which does not as such add distinctive features to the company’s end-product. An open source software standardization effort could also be a response to a competing proprietary standard or to attempt disrupting a monopolistic market. Another scenario could be that the company has identified a business model where the open source software project is used to drive broad adoption, but there is a good potential for revenue streams connected to services relating to the open source software project. In this context, so-called ‘dual licensing’ models are getting increasingly common, where the software is simultaneously released both as open source software – typically under a strong copyleft license  – and as a traditional commercial license. Further, one reason could simply be that the company lacks sufficient competence and knowledge to maintain a software asset and/or wishes to share the development and maintenance costs for it. The reason may even be altruistic, in the sense that the open source software asset holds no business value for the company but has a potential value for society (where an indirect business reason could be goodwill). Many other potential business reasons exist; the key point is that a company needs to identify at least one to proceed with the activity. 
When the question “why” is answered, it will as a next step be necessary to assess the suitability in terms of needed resources, engagement, timeframe, legal and IPR, etc. Starting an open source software project also comes with a set of choices, as further outlined below.

### Suitability and Choices 

Starting an open source software project is a strategic choice. Even if it has a limited impact in relation to the overall business of the company, it is still recommended to approach it as a strategic choice compared to other available alternatives. Thus, before creating such a project, a company should ask itself: 

•	Is it aligned with our company strategy to release this asset as open source software?

•	What will our future engagement be (in the short and long term)?

•	Will the potential benefits warrant the level of engagement (in the short and long term)? 

•	What is the expected outcome, and how can that be secured?

•	Are there any risks connected to the activity?

•	Are there any other open source software projects attempting to solve the same problem? If so, why create a new project instead of contributing to an existing project?

The suitability assessment set out in module 3.1 is generally applicable to the creation of an open source software project as well. Below follows a few examples of additional considerations relating to the creation of open source software projects.

**•	Governance model:** As mentioned in see module 3, open source software projects can be governed in different ways. It is essential to set up a governance model that will support the purpose of the project. As mentioned, projects controlled by a single company typically lack community-based governance fora such as Technical Steering Committees and the company appoints Committer roles to its employees to gatekeep all code going into the codebase. The benefit of this is of course a strong control position, but such a control position may also deter others from engaging in the project. An opposite extreme would be to “donate” the software asset to a neutral party, typically an existing Open Source Foundation (or a new foundation created for the purpose). A hybrid model can also be to have a phased approach, where the company retains initial control but gradually moves over to a meritocracy-based governance model. Depending on the size of the initiative, it could on the one hand be of such monumental scope that it requires some kind of umbrella organization with its own governance (and e.g. specific committees to handle technical sub-streams), and it could on the other hand be sufficient to have a very lean setup for a simple niche open source software library. Many variants exist, each with pros and cons. The bottom line is that the company should thoroughly consider which governance model fits best for the specific project.

**•	Communication:** Communication is an important part of launching – as well as maintaining – a successful open source software project. Roughly speaking, it needs to serve the high-level marketing purpose of attracting a strong community, as well as the detailed purpose of ensuring that all contributors understand the rules of engagement in the project. As such, consider which communication channels to use, how to clearly reach out with the project’s vision and problem statement (and the benefits of its purported solution), as well as more detailed day-to-day information. Consider engaging internal or external marketing expertise for larger open source software projects.

**•	Timing:** The timing of launching the open source software project is important from several perspectives. As a first example, the maturity of the asset itself is of course a factor – it will be significantly harder to gain traction for an unmaterialized idea compared to a working software application. Waiting too long, on the other hand, will waste internal resources on efforts which could potentially have been shared with others in open collaboration. If the purpose is standardization, there will always be a risk that other de facto standards grow strong while the company prepares to publish its own initiative. Once again, it will be important to find a good balance between speed and readiness to achieve the purpose, but as a general notion, the company should at least make sure to go through and make necessary preparations for the items proposed in this see module 3, as well as perform relevant technical reviews of the open source software asset (see module 3), before launching the project. 

**•	Choice of repository:** The choice to create an open source software project will also come with a choice of how to publish and host the software in question. The company should make an educated choice of repository to keep the code safe and version-controlled, and which facilitates collaboration and enables statistics and analysis as necessary. If in doubt, it is likely a good idea to use one of the reputable and well-known repository services on the market.

### Suitability and Choices – Legal & Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
When starting an open source software project, various legal and IPR aspects will need to be considered. In short, the company needs to:

•	Ensure that it is not violating third party rights.

•	Ensure that contributions and contributors are not violating third party rights.

•	Ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations. 

•	Choose relevant legal instruments (e.g. the open source software license) and policies for the project.

**Third party rights
**
The legal and IPR suitability assessment set out in module 3.1 is generally applicable to assets that the company itself puts into the open source software project, from the start as well as thereafter. In the following, additional considerations relating to the creation of open source software projects have been added.

**•	Choice of license:** The choice of license for the downstream distribution is highly connected to the goal of the open source software project. If it is crucial to drive continuous openness, it is an argument for choosing a copyleft license. If broad adoption by commercial downstream implementers and re-distributors is key, however, it is an argument for a non-copyleft license. If the software is created in a heavily patented landscape, it may be worth choosing a license with explicit patent language (patent license/non-assertion, etc.) rather than relying on licenses where patents are not mentioned (i.e. where the patent license is at best implied). If the software is intended to be combined with other open source software, make sure that the selected license is compatible (or if suitable identical) with the other open source software project license. In theory, a company can draft its own tailored license for the published software. However, this has the drawback of using a license that is not yet recognized by reputable institutions such as the Open Source Initiative, which in turn increases the threshold to establish general trust in the license and may make it harder to build a community. As such, the alternative of drafting a unique license is seldomly worth the effort (and lawyer hours), and should primarily be considered for strategic and large open source software projects with an equally strong branding agenda where the license can be branded as part of the initiative. Consult legal expertise if necessary to make a good choice in this respect. 

**•	Choice of contribution model:** The company needs to decide whether or not to use a CLA, DCO or other legal instrument to record inbound contributions of if it should simply make an inbound = outbound statement or similar. Like other decisions in this area, choices that increase the company’s control may at the same time deter collaborators and contributors from engaging in the open source software project. In any case, it is not advisable to leave it completely open for contributors to set terms and conditions for their contributions – that will eventually create chaos in the project and hamper both downstream and contributor interest. In conclusion, it is recommended to clearly communicate a contribution model to contributors, irrespective of whether it leans towards maximizing control (e.g. a CLA) or if the main driver is simplicity (e.g. an inbound=outbound statement). 
     
**•	Antitrust Guidelines:** As the facilitator of an open collaboration forum, the company may potentially also be inviting actual or potential competitors to participate in the co-creation of the open source software asset. This section will not attempt to exhaustively describe such legislation, but it is important to note that certain interactions and agreements between competitors are prohibited, in particular the creation of cartels. In certain jurisdictions, liability may extend also to a coordinator of a cartel between other parties. In light of this, it is generally advisable to establish an antitrust guideline for any open source software project where competitors may interact, and – needless to say – to comply with the said guideline and applicable antitrust and competition laws. 

**•	Data Privacy:** Please note that by governing an open source software project, the company may be deemed a data controller responsible for the processing of personal data under the GDPR and other data privacy laws. As such, make sure to establish customary privacy notices, cookie consent forms and other measures to ensure compliance with such laws.

## Operational aspects of maintaining engagement in an open source software project

Maintaining the engagement, after the company decision to continuously engage with dedicated resources in the open source software project, involves a continued company understanding of its engagement in terms of reasons to engage but also its ability to engage.

### Evaluating the engagement versus the exit criteria

Evaluating the engagement with an open source software project is a recurring process. It requires consideration whether the initial motivations remain valid and if the engagement is achieving its intended goals.
Companies may over time find reasons to reconsider or end their participation in open source projects. It is important to establish clear exit criteria and maintain open communication with the community to preserve good relationships and minimize disruptions. These factors are often related to a company's goals, brand image, product development, or sustainability objectives. If these goals are no longer met or aligned with the company's strategic direction, it may decide to stop contributing.
Reasons for a company to decide to disengage with an open source community might be due to changed company internal reasons, project related reasons or just other external factors outside of the project. Examples of exit criteria might include the following:
•	The company's original purpose for contributing is no longer relevant.

•	The project's focus has shifted and no longer matches defined purpose.

•	Another project aligns better with the company's objectives.

Other exit criteria examples:
•	The company's strategic goals have changed significantly.

•	The project's expected outcomes are no longer achievable.

•	The company’s expectation on the result of the engagement is not met.

•	The company's contributions are not used effectively.

•	The company's expertise in the project's area have diminished.

•	The company ability to contribute has decreased significantly.

•	The company cannot finance the necessary commitments and resources.

•	Risk for damage on brand image.

•	Legal risks or conflicts of interest arise.

•	Community engagement is low, impacting the project's sustainability.

•	Negative behaviors within the community hinder collaboration.

By defining exit criteria and engaging with the community, companies can responsibly manage their involvement in open source projects. These criteria should be periodically reviewed and communicated to both within the company and to the community. This approach maintains transparency, ensures positive relationships, and facilitates smooth transitions when adjustments to contributions or participation are necessary.

### Securing continued engagement
One part of securing a continued engagement by the company, if the evaluation to continue the engagement is positive, is to make sure the involved resources have the right competence and motivation to continue in combination with a reasonable opportunity to do so in terms of dedicated time and workload.

Another aspect of securing a continued engagement may be to assign additional resource(s) and competence(s) to supporting the appointed resource(s) for competence redundancy and future individual independency. 

Appointing someone to engage in a community is not only an investment in the community but also in the selected person. Creating internal company visibility of the engagement may also create increased attraction and motivation.

Other opportunities for the company to secure a continued engagement in the community may involve activities like hosting or sponsoring events for the community to meet and network as well as give presentations of the project. Such events can also serve as marketing opportunities for the company.
