## Business reasons for engaging in open source software development

When a company actively participates in open source software development by contributing code, resources, or expertise to open source software projects, it can derive several strategic advantages. Contribution is not just an act of goodwill but should be treated as a strategic move that aligns with the company’s broader goals and objectives.

### Strategic advantages of open source software contribution

Engaging in open source software contribution can align seamlessly with strategic business objectives, if done right. By using readily available open source components, companies can avoid reinventing the wheel and allocate resources more efficiently. Moreover, participating in open source communities can position a company at the forefront of innovation, providing access to emerging technologies and methodologies that can be integrated into their offerings. The important aspect of participating is to accelerate the evolution of a new technology and make it suitable for ones use cases. Consumption alone leaves you with what’s available. This engagement also expands market reach, tapping into a global pool of users and developers. Importantly, making appreciated contributions will also enhance a company’s influence and reputation within these communities, which can be a vital enabler for its open source strategy.

Strategic engagement in open source development can be crucial for securing a reliable technology supply. This involves identifying open source software components that are critical to the company's operation and developing a strategy to ensure their continued availability. By actively contributing to these components, a company can safeguard its technology supply, retaining the ability to use and adapt these components as needed.

Another strategic approach involves leveraging "early adopters" within the community. Early adopters can provide valuable feedback on new ideas or technologies at an early stage. By engaging the users in the community, a company can assess how a new technology or idea will be received before committing significant investments. This approach allows for agile adaptations based on real-world feedback, ensuring that developments are in line with community needs and expectations.

In the landscape of open source software, traditional business strategies, especially those involving financial influence, often need reevaluation. While many companies may use money to exert influence, this approach is not necessarily effective in open source environments. Unlike traditional business models where financial power drives decisions, open source software projects are primarily influenced by contributions. These contributions, whether in the form of code, expertise, or community support, are the true currency of influence in the world of open source software development.

Strategic engagements are closely tied to a long-term business strategy and require substantial staffing and long-term commitment.

### Product development through open source software

The open source model offers a unique advantage in product development. By using de-facto industry standard open source software components, a company can build its product(s) leveraging those and thereby accelerate product development. However, relying on these components also involves a degree of dependency on the community for updates and support. To mitigate risks such as delayed community support, companies can develop solutions or bug fixes and then contribute this back to the community for mutual benefit. This relationship results in easier maintenance, faster feature development, and overall higher quality. Contributions should be closely aligned with the strategy and roadmap of a product to ensure business relevance.

Additionally, open source software contributions can be strategically used for competitive advantages. Companies can initiate or contribute to open source software projects to develop new products or frameworks that are aligned with and support existing product ecosystems. This strategy can establish a company's dominance in specific technical areas. Apple's development of Swift, Google's investment in Android, and Microsoft's contribution to .NET and C# are examples of how leading tech companies have used open source contributions to create platforms that serve immediate product needs and set industry standards. Such strategic contributions allow companies to shape the technical landscape in ways that favor their products and services, which can give them a significant competitive advantage.

### Standardization strategies

Active involvement in open source software projects enables companies to influence industry standards. This strategic participation ensures that the evolving standards are aligned with the company’s interest, allowing them to influence the future direction of technology and industry practices. Moreover, actively being involved can improve interoperability with the company’s software and hardware to reduce compatibility issues. Additionally, engagement in standardization can serve a tactical purpose. Companies can drive de-facto standards through their contributions. By actively shaping these standards, companies can steer development in directions that are aligned with preferred technologies to create standards that will benefit the company’s strategic position.

### Open collaboration ecosystem

Open source software projects provide a neutral, open platform for collaboration among different stakeholders. An open approach to innovation encourages healthy competition and growth, fostering an environment where ideas can be freely exchanged and improved. The collaborative nature of open source development is not merely about code development, but it is a holistic approach involving idea sharing and problem solving to develop and enhancing software. Moreover, decisions are often facilitated made through open discussions, but maintainers typically take the final decisions.

### Ensuring the sustainability of open source initiatives

A common misconception about open source software is that it is “free” in the sense of having no cost. While it is true that open source software typically comes without license fees, it is crucial to understand that this does not equate to being free of cost. The vitality and attractiveness of open source projects depend on continued engagement and support. These projects thrive on the contribution of their community. Therefore, businesses must recognize the implicit costs associated with consuming open source.

Supporting the open source ecosystem is not just about contributing code – it is about taking responsibility for the sustainability of these initiatives. Companies benefit from open source software and, in turn, have a role to play in ensuring its longevity and health through contributions, it can be code, but also infrastructure, resources, or community engagement.

### Marketing, goodwill, and employer branding

A company’s contribution to open source development can significantly enhance its market image and that is more likely to happen if the project also has a good reputation and performance. This promotes goodwill among customers and partners and boosts the company’s attractiveness as an employer. In today’s competitive talent market, a strong brand associated with innovation and community contribution can be an important decision factor for potential employees.
Preparing the business to handle open source software development
A company considering engaging in open source software development should as part of its preparation consider these areas:

* Governance structure
* Contribution strategy
* Contribution process
* Contribution team
* Awareness and training

**Governance structure:** A formal governance structure with a stated ownership shall specify a company strategy & policy. It shall also include a mandated process with guidelines of how contributions are to be made with documented criteria for contribution decisions. The governance shall also provide a declaration of the involved roles with responsibility including a declaration of who owns the final decision to make the contribution or not.

**Contribution strategy:** Declaring a company stance on open source software contributions in terms of sharing - its resources or financial support as well as its IPR - enables engagement. Establishing a strategy will provide guardrails of what type of contributions the company will perform with possible limitations of engagement. The range of possible engagement spans all previously mentioned contribution types, as listed in chapter 1.2.

**Contribution process:** A common company process outlining the required steps for making an open source contribution will enable a uniform contribution handling and thus minimize the risk of any unwanted effects, like unintended IPR sharing, from the intended contribution effort. It will also support overall awareness and possible synchronization between different contribution efforts and thus enable strategic overview.

**Contribution team:** Forming a cross competence team, for contribution management and support, may include representation of legal, IPR, technical and marketing for reviewing contribution requests and providing a documented recommendation for the approver, which might be the contribution team itself. The approver of the contribution request shall document the decision for future reference. Depending on the different type of contribution alternatives in combination with contribution volumes, there might exist a need of different contribution paths for review and decision. Such paths may include a review for blanket approvals within a specific scope, or continuous reviews for every contribution depending on sensitivity level.

**Awareness and training:** A general understanding of the open source software development area, including both consumption and contribution, is a necessity for consideration of a company open source development engagement.

The company could provide information fulfilling the needed basic level of open source software understanding, for instance through training. The company also should provide specific training for employees getting involved in the company contribution effort. Such training should also increase the awareness internally of the decided strategy, the roles involved and the process including the decision making.

A company guideline may be provided on how contribution and external engagement shall be performed by the employees as representatives of the company. Open source contribution engagement is also an opportunity of company branding which of course depends on the selected contribution stance.
