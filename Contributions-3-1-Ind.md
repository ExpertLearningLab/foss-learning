## The business process of making an open source software contribution part 1

### Contributions to existing open source software projects

The business process of engaging in existing open source software projects can be set up in various ways and be subject to different governance models, depending on a company’s needs and capabilities.
Regardless of if the decision is made through an ad hoc process or if it passes through a sophisticated setup (e.g. with an Open Source Program Office (OSPO)), the process should in the end lead to the following three cornerstones:

* Purpose. A defined purpose for the specific contribution activity.

* Suitability. A suitability assessment from relevant perspectives, based on the purpose.

* Conscious decision. A conscious decision based on the above, including the allocation of adequate and suitable resources.

Please note: This module does not refer to spare-time contributions made by employees outside of work. In that context, it is important to note that in most cases (either by law or contract), the copyright to a developer’s code – insofar as it falls within his or her job description – will be automatically transferred to the employer. It is generally advisable for companies to have a process to get notified about and approve employee spare-time activities that may border to or affect the day-to-day work, subject to local employment legislation. Open source software contributions are not an exception in that regard.

### Defining the purpose of the open source software contribution

As described in module 2, there are many possible reasons for a company to engage in open source software development through contributions. When considering a specific contribution case, the task is essentially to identify which of these reasons apply to the case in question. In short: why make this contribution?
If there is no obvious answer to that question, it is likely due to one out of two reasons:

1. The company is immature in the open source software business strategic dimension, lacking sufficient capabilities, structures and/or strategies to answer the question.
See Module 2.

1. The contribution does not fit with the company strategy and is thereby questionable.

On the other hand, if there is an obvious business reason to engage in a particular open source software project, the question “why” will generally be relatively simple to answer and define.

For instance, the reason may be that the company is relying on a specific open source software component which has a declining community, and the company therefore wants to boost the continued engagement and redundance in the open source software project. Defining such a purpose will immediately uncover several aspects. To begin with, to truly boost engagement in the open source software project, it is unlikely that sporadic issue reports or the occasional suggestion of a bug fix will do enough to fulfil the purpose. Instead, it is likely that the company may need to engage continuously, also with more substantial types of contributions (see module 1) and even commit to assume roles higher up in the project hierarchy (see module 1).

When the question “why” is answered, the possibility to assess the contribution is significantly improved, both in terms of suitability and in terms of needed resources, engagement, timeframe, etc.

In companies with a mature open source development management organization and where governance has been established, standardized forms for contribution requests should preferably require the internal requester to specify the open source software project in question and the reasons for engaging in it. This can be particularly helpful in larger organizations and/or in companies with a high volume of open source software contribution requests. As a suggestion, such forms could include:

* The name and scope of the open source software project

* Relevant links (to the repository, project website and the website of any governing body such as the relevant Open Source Foundation)

* Information about the type(s) of contribution(s) intended

  * If source code will be contributed, a specification of the same

* The reason(s) why the contribution(s) would be beneficial for the company

* Exit criteria (if it is a continuous contribution)
