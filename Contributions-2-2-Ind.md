## Standardization strategies

Active involvement in open source software projects enables companies to influence industry standards. This strategic participation ensures that the evolving standards are aligned with the company’s interest, allowing them to influence the future direction of technology and industry practices. Moreover, actively being involved can improve interoperability with the company’s software and hardware to reduce compatibility issues. Additionally, engagement in standardization can serve a tactical purpose. Companies can drive de-facto standards through their contributions. By actively shaping these standards, companies can steer development in directions that are aligned with preferred technologies to create standards that will benefit the company’s strategic position.

## Open collaboration ecosystem

Open source software projects provide a neutral, open platform for collaboration among different stakeholders. An open approach to innovation encourages healthy competition and growth, fostering an environment where ideas can be freely exchanged and improved. The collaborative nature of open source development is not merely about code development, but it is a holistic approach involving idea sharing and problem solving to develop and enhancing software. Moreover, decisions are often facilitated made through open discussions, but maintainers typically take the final decisions.

## Ensuring the sustainability of open source initiatives

A common misconception about open source software is that it is “free” in the sense of having no cost. While it is true that open source software typically comes without license fees, it is crucial to understand that this does not equate to being free of cost. The vitality and attractiveness of open source projects depend on continued engagement and support. These projects thrive on the contribution of their community. Therefore, businesses must recognize the implicit costs associated with consuming open source.

Supporting the open source ecosystem is not just about contributing code – it is about taking responsibility for the sustainability of these initiatives. Companies benefit from open source software and, in turn, have a role to play in ensuring its longevity and health through contributions, it can be code, but also infrastructure, resources, or community engagement.
