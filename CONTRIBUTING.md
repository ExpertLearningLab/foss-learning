### Changes of the structure or adding new material

Changes of the structure of the material, for instance splitting text into separate files or adding content in new files, requires corresponding changes in the training course player (PECA Player). These changes must be made separately and cannot be controlled from this GitHub repository. Therefore, if you make such changes, please point this out in your PR so that the new content will be reviewed and added to the course player.

## Contributions as part of the "contribution exercise"

The training course on contributions includes an exercise which tasks learners to make a sample contribution to this repository. Learners should follow the same steps as listed above, subject to the following two differences:

* Any changes should only be made to the sample file *Contributions-exercise.md*,
* The PR will be reviewed but eventually closed instead of merged.
