# Introduction

This course covers the key concepts related to the reuse of open source software as part of a software supply chain. We address topics such as open source software repositories, dependency management, automatic build and integration, as well as the security aspects related to software development and reuse. For each topic, we introduce the main technical concepts, we survey the state of the art, as well as the state of practice. We also provide a summary in the form of DIY tasks.

## Target audience

The content of this site is intended for software developers, architects, site reliability engineers and project managers who care about software quality and resilient supply chains of open source software.
