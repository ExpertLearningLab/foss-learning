# Fundamentals of OSS

Software projects [depend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down) on other software projects to achieve their goals. Open-source software projects can be likened to building blocks: they play a crucial role in both open- and closed-source, or commercial, software systems. For example, a commercial software application may rely on the features provided by open-source [PDF](https://github.com/apache/pdfbox) manipulation libraries to generate invoices. Most [database](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_osvsc) solutions powering commercial software systems are open-source. Open-source tools may also be used for real-time [monitoring](https://prometheus.io/) of commercial software systems in production. The open-source [software supply chain](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/software-supply-chain-management-an-introduction) powers billions of dollars in financial transactions (see reference [4](#ref_4)). Learning about open-source software projects, and how they can be used, is therefore very relevant for all industrial domains and enterprises.
