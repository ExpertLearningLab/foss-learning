### Ethical Responsibilities

Anyone representing a company as a professional in the open source software community are presented with unique opportunities, but also entrusted with significant responsibilities. That employee becomes part of the company’s branding, representing its values and commitment to collaboration, innovation, and excellence in every interaction with the open source community. It is essential to not just develop the technical expertise but have strong ethical mindset that is aligned with the specific demands and the subtle distinction of the role. Understanding and executing these responsibilities are of greatest importance when participating in open source software initiatives.

**Key responsibilities and best practices:**

As contributing employee, it is crucial to

* Understand company policies: Read and understand the company's code of conduct and its policy on open source contributions. Ensure staying within them and secure the necessary approvals to contribute to the project. Keep in mind that the employee is responsible for his/her conduct and should always act with the company's principles and values in mind. In situations where the right course of action is not clear, the employee should not hesitate to contact and consult the company’s support functions. As a general principle, if something seems unethical or improper, it probably is.

* Build legal and IP skills: Be knowledgeable about open source licenses, contributor license agreements (CLA), and developer certificate of origin (DCO) to ensure compliance and avoid legal pitfalls. Protect company IP and ensure not to share proprietary or otherwise confidential company information, see Chapter 3.

* [Respect community norms](https://chrisholdgraf.com/blog/2020/organizations-help-oss-guide/){:target="_blank"}{:target="_blank"}: Each community has its own culture, norms, guidelines, agreements (CLA or DCO) and codes of conduct, see Chapter 3. Understand and respect these rules and guidelines, including contribution guidelines. Contribute in a manner that is in harmony with the community's culture. Ensure that these expectations are in line with the company's policies and code of conduct.

* Be honest and sincere: Be transparent with company affiliation when contributing to open source projects. Identify and disclose any potential conflicts of interest. Always act ethically and contribute with integrity.

* Understand the objectives: Grasp the company’s overall strategic objectives and the project’s specific goals. Clearly understand the reasons for the company involvement in the open source software project, and ensure that any actions and contributions align with these objectives and the company’s broader mission, see Chapter 2.
